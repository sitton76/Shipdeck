# Shipdeck
 A tool meant for managing mods and write Load Order entries into the config file used in Ship of Harkinian.
 
To use the program, you must have a existing shipofharkinian.json file, additionally you must have a exisiting mods folder with .otr file mods inside of it to manage.

To use the program:
1. Open a version of the program for your OS.
2. Click on the "Select SoH config folder" button, select the folder containing the shipofharkinian.json file.
3. The Mod List should populate at this point, click the name of the mod to move it between lists, when mods are under the Load Order list you should see up and down buttons, this determines load order, mods on top load first, and on bottom load last.
4. When you are happy with your load order, press the "Save Load Order" button to save changes to your shipofharkinian.json file, if the Load Order list is empty it will remove the entries related to the load order and SoH will revert to its default method of loading mods.

Huge thanks to Purple Hato and ProxySaw for valuable feedback on how this tool and its implementation on SoH should work.
